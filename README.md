A. Input:-
   
   XY Normal Map:- This is where you have to connect the BC5/XY Normal map
   
   Normal Strength:- This sets the Strength of fixed Normal map. Only works for the vector output "Normal"
   
   Invert Blue:- in Some games, they store some texture in the blue channel of BC5 compressed Textures. In that case if the texture need inversion, then change            the value from 0 to 1.
   
B. Output:- 
   
   Normal map:- The fixed Normal map as texture
   
   Normal:- The Fixed Normal map as vector.
   
   Blue Channel:- if any additional texture is present in the blue channel of BC5 compressed, then this is the output. Generally Roughness/Smoothness is stored(if).
